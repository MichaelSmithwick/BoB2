Experimentation with UE4

In this project there is a lot of little experiments, a ground vehicle driving experiment with a car, a blueprint controlled aircraft, and an aircraft control via programmable (C++) control. There is also experimentation with streaming levels using World Composition streaming and streaming volumes via blueprints, programming, and with only native UE4 functionality.

The project is currently setup for the C++ controlled airplane.

The number keypad is used to fly the plane.
The following keys on the number keypad have the following functions:

Num +      Increase Throttle
Num Enter  Decrease Throttle
Num 2      Pitch nose up
Num 8      Pitch nose down
Num 4      Roll Left
Num 6      Roll Right
Num 1      Yaw Left
Num 3      Yaw Right
Num 5      Center all controls (also stops rotation about all 3 axises)
Home       Return aircraft to starting position
Escape     Exit game.

I recommend flying at about 120 kts because it is easy to fly out of the game "box" when flying at full speed.
If you fly out of the game box the plane will disappear and you will be unable to do anything except hit the Escape key
and start over again.
The land mass is at the center of the box so keeping close to this is a good idea.
The sun makes a good locating point.
By flying directly at the sun and doing a 5/8 loop followed by a half roll (half cuban 8) will generally put the land mass in your sights.
After flying towards the sun the land mass can generally be found on a 30 degree heading.

When the throttle is retarded to a zero setting the aircraft will stop almost immediately. This effect can be used to land
the aircraft like a helecopter (straight down) on the land mass. Approach the land mass somewhat in the manner of a conventional
approach and when over your chosen landing spot cut the throttle to zero and land straight down vertically.

Have fun
